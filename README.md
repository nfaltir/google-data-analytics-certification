# Google Data Analytics Certification

## Intro

The Google Data Analytics Certification is offered by Google through Coursera. Its a certification that establishes the foundation of data analytics. The certification requires 8 courses with lessons (video lectures, readings, labs, quizzes) and an exam at the end of each course. You must pass all course exams with a 80% grade to get your certification. Google recommends 6 months to complete the certification, but ideally you can do it in less than a month or three/two weeks.

### Pros

- The course follows a solid framework into data analytics. It puts great emphasis on the ‘Why’ question and how you should structure your thinking and objectives before you even process or analyze data
- The production team at Google for this course did a great job in compiling the materials and their presentation is great.
- The course teaches you how to use some of the technologies they use at google for analytics such as BigQuery, Tableau (might be Looker), R Studio, and Google Sheets.
- Useful tips on resume building

### Cons

- I am disappointed they didn’t use python as the core programming language for this course. They opt for R instead.
- The lessons on SQL, Tableau, and R is quite limiting, it was more focused on getting you started and less on solving practical problems that you might face in the data industry.
- Google needs to have moderators examining the course discussion board, it is riddled with spam.

At the end of the course you will  be required to choose from two case studies or create one for your capstone. I chose the first case study. I chose R to code all my analysis, visualizations, and report. I highly recommend this course, you will find it useful if you are into analytics.
